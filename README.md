# Hello everyone, I'm Kanishk Kumar, a student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science. 
Welcome to my portfolio.
On this site, you'll find a showcase of my projects and skills developed through my journey as a computer science student. I wanted my project to be interactive and responsive.
On my homepage, you'll see a little about who I am, dynamically changing to highlight my roles as a software engineer and a coder.
Here are some of my top projects. Clicking on any of these will take you directly to the GitHub repositories where you can explore the code in detail.
The skills section showcases my expertise in various technologies. These skills have been developed through both academic and practical project experiences.
In the future, I plan to make my portfolio even more personalized and beautiful. 

A portfolio is a living document that evolves over time. Regular updates and continuous improvement are necessary to make sure that it remains a powerful tool in my professional toolkit.
